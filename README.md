### Predicting Stock Price From Historical Data

**Zaid Aboush**

#### Executive summary
This capstone project is about predicting stock market prices on which a decision can be made on whether to buy, hold or sell. 
#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question? Predicting stock price may help people focus their resources to obtain better return of investment and grow financially. 

#### Research Question
What are we trying to answer? How an accurate ML model can be build to predict future stock price(s)

#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer you question? My instructor provided me with a historical Netflix stock prices that goes all the way back to 2018, here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/netflix-stock-price-prediction?select=NFLX.csv

#### Methodology
What methods are we using to answer the question? In this project I have been using various techniques to estimate future stock prices:
1-	Decision Tree: I used historical closing price data as an input feature as well as target variable for SVM modelling after splitting the data (90% training & 10 testing).
2-	Support vector machine: I used historical closing price data as an input feature as well as target variable for SVM modelling after splitting the data (90% training & 10 testing)
3-	Time series analysis such as S/ARIMA (Seasonal/ARIMA) that combines autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) as well as handling seasonal patterns 

#### Results
What did your research find?

#### Next steps
What suggestions do you have for next steps? Look into other company stock price prediction such as Qualcomm and try to incorporate other input features like technical indications that may includes RSI, MACD, or Bollinger Bands.
